# Page Optimization

## Causes of a Slow-Loading Web Page and Fixes

1. **Large Image Files**
   - *Cause:* High-resolution images increase load time.
   - *Fix:* Compress images or use WebP format. Implement lazy loading.

2. **Unoptimized JavaScript/CSS**
   - *Cause:* Unminified scripts or unused libraries.
   - *Fix:* Minify files, remove unused code, and use async/defer attributes.

3. **Too Many HTTP Requests**
   - *Cause:* Multiple small files being loaded separately.
   - *Fix:* Combine assets, use a CDN, and enable browser caching.
